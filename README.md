# CourseRadar (Current development phase: Prototype)
This is a senior design software project from team Tit4Tat. Basically, it is an Android application that UB students can 
view and share course informations, syllabus abstractions, professor ratings, and sell used educational resources.

## For Developers
Since our backend is Google Firebase, we will deal with collaboration-related stuff in later phases. For now, you can still clone this
repository and take a look at our code, but you won't be able to interact with our backend.

## For Users
Our app now supports Android 5.0.0(Lollipop) to 8.0.0(Oreo), since this prototype is not deployed on Google Play Store,
please download the APK file from the link below:

NOTE: if your smartphone asks for permission to install APK from unknown sources, please grant permission to proceed.
